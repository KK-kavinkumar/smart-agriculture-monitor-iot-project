2.2.1 is latest version - Windows 10
For Windows 7, Arduino IDE 1.8.19
If any extra drivers are asking for install permission, install them also.
After installing, open the software as ADMINISTRATOR

*******************************************
NOW FOLLOW THESE STEPS (See video)

Paste the below two links into the box in the "Additional Board Manager URL" in Preference options of "File"
File --> Preferences --> Additional Board Manager URL

https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

I will upload this notepad file in whatsapp group.

In Board Manager options, search for esp8266 and install that board.
After that, install esp32 from "Expressif Systems" in the same method.
It will install ESP32 board and NodeMCU ESP8266 board in your software.
Do this even if you are using only Arduino UNO or NANO.

Arduino UNO and NANO are already available in your software.

********************************************

CONNECT YOUR BOARD TO YOUR LAPTOP'S USB PORT AND THEN FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW.

To use Arduino UNO board, go to Tools --> Boards --> AVR Boards --> Arduino Uno
To use Arduino UNO board, go to Tools --> Boards --> AVR Boards --> Arduino Nano
To use NodeMCU board, go to Tools --> Boards --> 8266 --> NodeMCU 1.0
To use ESP32 board, go to Tools --> Boards --> ESP32 --> ESP VROOM Board
To use ESP32 CAM board, go to Tools --> Boards --> ESP32 --> ESP32 Wrover Module

After selecting board, go to Tools --> Ports --> SELECT PORT NUMBER OTHER THAN COM1

***************************************
If many ports are showing, go to Windows button --> Type "Device Manager"
Open the Device Manager and search for PORTS (COM & LPT)
In that options, see what port is showing other than COM1.
Sometimes, the board will be shown as "Silicon Labs CP210x". Note that port number.
Come back to Arduino IDE software and select that port in Tools option.

***************************************
If port option is not showing, then you need to update CP2102 driver from this link.
https://www.pololu.com/file/0J14/pololu-cp2102-windows-220616.zip
Download this zip file and open the "pololu-cp2102-setup-x64.exe" if your laptop is 64 bit
During the installation, Windows will ask you if you want to install the drivers.
Click “Install”.
Come back to Arduino IDE software and try ports option from Tools.
Select proper port number in Tools option.

***************************************
To Test your works till now;

Open File --> New Sketch and upload the code without modifying anything.
If it shows "Done Uploading", then your installation is correct and completed.
You can start your projects after that.

****************************************************
After installation, open this google drive link.
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TVUc-qH_sXL5jFxCFY0ZE5ZKqnCrwmYn?usp=sharing

In that folder, Search for the pdf file "Interdisciplinary _project Mela (1) (1)".
In that pdf, search for your required project title.
Note down the serial number of that project and close the pdf.
Now you can open the serial number folder of your project and download that folder to your laptop.
In each folder, Arduino code for the project, Circuit diagram for the project and other needed items will be there.

Rest we will see in tomorrow's session.

Remember, Learning is not a one day operation. So continue your good works.
